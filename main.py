# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it


# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.
# Print your name.
# Print today's date.
# Print the name of your favorite movie.

# Print your name and age on separate lines using a single print() function.
# Use f-strings to print a message like: "In 10 years, [Your Name] will be [Your Age + 10] years old."

#syntax is the way we write code
# print("Hello World")
# name = "John"
#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variabes with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value
word = "python is cool and stuff and im bored" #string variable
print(word)
print(word[0])
print(word[13])
print(word[19])
print(word[23])
print(word[-1])
print(word[-2])
print(word[-3])
#0 prints the first letter of the string
#spaces count as characters
#string slicing
print(word[10:14])
#10 is inclusive, 14 is exclusive. stop before 14
print(word[19:24])
print(word[0:6])
print(word[7:9])
print(word[15:18])
print(word[-1:-6])
print(word[0:])
print(word[:-1])
print(len(word))
#(len) measures out and tells you the length of the string
print(word[:13])
print(word[5:])
#what if I wanted to find a substring/word?
#a substring is a word inside of a sentence
print(word.find("is"))
#finds the index of a substring
print(word.find("and"))
#index is 15
#how do we uppercase letters
print(word.upper())
#uppercases entire document
print(word.capitalize())
#only uppercases first letter/capitalizes it
cool=word[10:14]
print(cool)
print(cool.capitalize())
print(word.replace("python","javascript"))
print(word.replace("cool","ugly"))




#challenge
# find a summary of blue beetle online and create a 
# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it
# hint: google it
# print the length of the summary
s="An alien scarab chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle "
print(s)
# upper case the entire summary
print(s.upper())
# print the summary
print(s)
# print the summary in lowercase
print(s.lower())
# replace the word blue with red
print(s.replace("blue","red"))
# print the summary
print(s)
# string index the word beetle and print it out
print(s.find("beetle"))
print(s[-7:-1])
# print the last word of the summary
print(s[-7:-1])
# print the summary in reverse
print(s[::-1])





# String Practice #1: try this in repl.it
# Define a string containing your full name.
# Print the first 3 letters of your name using string slicing.
# Convert your name to uppercase and print the result.
# Use string formatting to print "My name is [Your Name]."

# String Practice #2
# Write Python code that prints the following, by calling the print function just once:
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Line 3

# String Practice #3
# Write Python code that prints the following:
# A	B	C
# D	E	F
# G	H	I

# String Practice #3
# Write Python code that prints the following:
# Backslash (\)
# Forward Slash (/)

##########################input practice#############################################
# Input Practice #1
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# What are you learning today?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #2
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# Where are you from?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #3
# Write Python code that displays the user's full name on the screen, by allowing them to enter their first and last name with the following instructions:
# What is your name?
# What is your surname?
# The code must be able to print the user's first and last name on the screen, separated by a space.

# Exercise:
# Write a program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a message using both pieces of information.
